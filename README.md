# DATA-MINING-ANALYSIS-Course-Project-Identifying-Deepfakes

## 📖 Overview  
Deepfakes, or AI generated images resembling real-world people, can now be indistinguisible from genuine photos. The paper [HiDF: A Human-Indistinguishable Deepfake Dataset](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3711896.3737399), compiles a collection of just such images.

This repository aims to utilize data mining techniques to analyze this dataset and develop new ways to more accurately and precisely identify deepfakes.

## 📝 Notes  
- This repo is part of a semester long project and is a WIP.
